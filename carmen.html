        <h2>Life of Carmen Hernandez of Neo Catechumenal Way.</h2>
        <div class="carmen-text">
          Carmen was, along with Kiko, an initiator of the Way. She was born in
          Ólvega (Soria, España) on November 24, 1930. She was the fifth of nine
          children, four men and five women; she lived her childhood years in
          Tudela (Navarra, Spain).
        </div>

        <div class="carmen-text">
          In Tudela, she studied at the school Compañía de María (Company of
          Mary) and had contact with Compañía de Jesús (Jesuits). Being
          influenced by the missionary spirit of St. Francis Xavier from a young
          age, she felt that her vocation was to go in mission to India.
          According to her father’s wishes, she begins to study chemistry in
          1948 in Madrid, where she graduates with the highest grades in 1954.
        </div>

        <div class="carmen-text">
          During a time, she worked with her father in the food industry, in a
          factory that the family had in Andújar (Jaén), but decided to leave
          the job to move to Javier, where she entered into a new missionary
          institute: the Missionaries of Christ Jesus. After her time in the
          novitiate, she studied Theology in the house of theological formation
          for religious in Valencia. in 1960, she was assigned to India. For
          that mission, she had to go to London to prepare (at that time, India
          still belonged to the English Commonwealth), where she remained one
          year. In that time, there was a change of direction in the
          Missionaries of Christ Jesus which limited the openness to the mission
          of the order, so Carmen returned from London to Barcelona. There she
          meets Father Pedro Farnés Scherer, who had just completed his studies
          at the Institute of Liturgy in Paris, shortly before the Second
          Vatican Council and who after it, actively participated in the
          Consilium for its realization.
        </div>

        <div class="carmen-text">
          In his classes, Fr. Farnés presented the pascal sources of the
          Eucharist and a renewed ecclesiology that was presenting the Church as
          light of the nations. Carmen’s lively contact with authors of this
          conciliar renewal had a great influence, later on, in the formation of
          the catechesis of the Neocatechumenal Way.
        </div>

        <div class="carmen-text">
          Carmen spent two years, from the middle of 1963 to 1964, in the Holy
          Land with her bible, visitng holy sites. Upon her return to Madrid,
          she began to work in the shanty towns of the periphery, thinking of
          going as a missionary to Bolivia with other celibate lay people.
          However, there she meets Kiko Argüello, who lived in the shanty towns
          of Palomeras Altas, and decides to stay in the same area. In the midst
          of the poor, they both discovered the strength of the Paschal Mystery
          and of the preaching of the Kerygma (the Good News of the dead and
          risen Christ) and they witnessed the birth of the first community.
          Thanks to the confirmation of this new reality by the archbishop of
          Madrid Mons. Casimiro Morcillo, Carmen started to work with Kiko,
          bringing to parishes, first in Madrid, then to Rome and thereafter to
          other cities and nations – this work of renewal of the Church.

        <div class="carmen-text">
          Carmen Hernández passed away on July 19, 2016 in Madrid, Spain. At her
          funeral, presided by the Cardinal Archbishop of Madrid Carlos Osoro
          Sierra, and attended by thousands of people, Fr. Mario Pezzi stressed
          that with the Way, it is “the first time in history that an ecclesial
          reality is founded by a man and a woman who have been constantly
          collaborating together for over 50 years.” In addition, the Pope sent
          a message in which he said he received “with emotion” the news of
          Carmen’s death and highlighted her long life “marked by her love of
          Jesus and by a great missionary enthusiasm.” “I give thanks to the
          Lord for the witness of this woman, encouraged by a sincere love for
          the church, who has spent her life announcing the Good News in every
          place, even in the most far away, never forgetting the most
          marginalized people.”, wrote the Pope. Francis.
