          <h2>Life of Carmen Hernandez of Neo Catechumenal Way.</h2>
          <div class="carmen-text">
            Carmen was, along with Kiko, an initiator of the Way. She was born
            in Ólvega (Soria, España) on November 24, 1930. She was the fifth of
            nine children, four men and five women; she lived her childhood
            years in Tudela (Navarra, Spain).
          </div>

          <div class="carmen-text">
            In Tudela, she studied at the school Compañía de María (Company of
            Mary) and had contact with Compañía de Jesús (Jesuits). Being
            influenced by the missionary spirit of St. Francis Xavier from a
            young age, she felt that her vocation was to go in mission to India.
            According to her father’s wishes, she begins to study chemistry in
            1948 in Madrid, where she graduates with the highest grades in 1954.
          </div>

          <div class="carmen-text">
            During a time, she worked with her father in the food industry, in a
            factory that the family had in Andújar (Jaén), but decided to leave
            the job to move to Javier, where she entered into a new missionary
            institute: the Missionaries of Christ Jesus. After her time in the
            novitiate, she studied Theology in the house of theological
            formation for religious in Valencia. in 1960, she was assigned to
            India. For that mission, she had to go to London to prepare (at that
            time, India still belonged to the English Commonwealth), where she
            remained one year. In that time, there was a change of direction in
            the Missionaries of Christ Jesus which limited the openness to the
            mission of the order, so Carmen returned from London to Barcelona.
            There she meets Father Pedro Farnés Scherer, who had just completed
            his studies at the Institute of Liturgy in Paris, shortly before the
            Second Vatican Council and who after it, actively participated in
            the Consilium for its realization.
          </div>

          <div class="carmen-text">
            In his classes, Fr. Farnés presented the pascal sources of the
            Eucharist and a renewed ecclesiology that was presenting the Church
            as light of the nations. Carmen’s lively contact with authors of
            this conciliar renewal had a great influence, later on, in the
            formation of the catechesis of the Neocatechumenal Way.
          </div>

          <div class="carmen-text">
            Carmen spent two years, from the middle of 1963 to 1964, in the Holy
            Land with her bible, visitng holy sites. Upon her return to Madrid,
            she began to work in the shanty towns of the periphery, thinking of
            going as a missionary to Bolivia with other celibate lay people.
            However, there she meets Kiko Argüello, who lived in the shanty
            towns of Palomeras Altas, and decides to stay in the same area. In
            the midst of the poor, they both discovered the strength of the
            Paschal Mystery and of the preaching of the Kerygma (the Good News
            of the dead and risen Christ) and they witnessed the birth of the
            first community. Thanks to the confirmation of this new reality by
            the archbishop of Madrid Mons. Casimiro Morcillo, Carmen started to
            work with Kiko, bringing to parishes, first in Madrid, then to Rome
            and thereafter to other cities and nations – this work of renewal of
            the Church.
          </div>

          <div class="carmen-text">
            Carmen Hernández passed away on July 19, 2016 in Madrid, Spain. At
            her funeral, presided by the Cardinal Archbishop of Madrid Carlos
            Osoro Sierra, and attended by thousands of people, Fr. Mario Pezzi
            stressed that with the Way, it is “the first time in history that an
            ecclesial reality is founded by a man and a woman who have been
            constantly collaborating together for over 50 years.” In addition,
            the Pope sent a message in which he said he received “with emotion”
            the news of Carmen’s death and highlighted her long life “marked by
            her love of Jesus and by a great missionary enthusiasm.” “I give
            thanks to the Lord for the witness of this woman, encouraged by a
            sincere love for the church, who has spent her life announcing the
            Good News in every place, even in the most far away, never
            forgetting the most marginalized people.”, wrote the Pope. Francis.

            Oh Lord, who in choosing Carmen Hernández as co-initiator of the
            Neocatechumenal Way, granted her a great love for Jesus Christ and
